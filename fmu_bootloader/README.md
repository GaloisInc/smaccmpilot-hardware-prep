# Pixhawk FMU Bootloader

The factory USB bootloader firmware image is provided in this directory as
`px4fmuv2_bl.elf`.

This is provided for the convenience of users who have previously soldered a
JTAG/SWD header onto their Pixhawk and uploaded a bare-metal firmware image
which erased the factory USB bootloader.

Upload this image to the FMU using your JTAG/SWD debugger.
